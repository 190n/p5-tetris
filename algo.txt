"current" - reference to where to insert new tree items
when making a drop, add all possibilities as a sub of current and add an empty object to each one
when a whole tree has been tried, remove it

maybe don't need the tree?
just a lot of recursion

structure:

{
    [drop1]: {
        [drop1]: {}
        [drop2]: {
            [drop1]: false // this caused there to be no more room but the board wasn't full
        }
    }
    [drop2]: {}
}
